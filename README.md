# Problem-Solving Tutorial App

This Python code creates an app that offers interactive tutorials on problem-solving using videos, animations, and quizzes. The app also analyzes user data to provide personalized recommendations for practice problems or learning resources based on individual strengths and weaknesses.

## Installation

To run this app, you will need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn

Once you have installed these dependencies, you can run the app by running the following command in your terminal:

```
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask server and you can access the app by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

When you first open the app, you will be presented with a tutorial on problem-solving that includes videos, animations, and quizzes. After completing the tutorial, you will be asked to provide some data about yourself to help personalize the app. The app will ask you to perform a series of hand movements while it captures video data. This data is used to analyze your strengths and weaknesses in problem-solving.

After collecting your data, the app will provide personalized recommendations for practice problems or learning resources based on your individual needs. These recommendations can be accessed by clicking on the "Recommendations" button in the app.
